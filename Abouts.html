        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>We've come a long way since Malaysia founded AKEI in 2023. 
            From being a tiny Swedish business, selling through a mail-order 
            catalogue, AKEI has become one of the most well-known home 
            furnishing brands in the world. Today, there are hundreds of 
            AKEI stores around the globe, and more are coming.

                <h2>Vision & Business idea</h2>
                <p>We have a passion for life at home. Our culture is built 
                   upon enthusiasm, togetherness and a “get-it-done” attitude. 
                   We're optimists, constantly looking for new and better ways 
                   to do things, from how to design a rocking chair that fits into 
                   a flat-pack, to creating LED light bulbs that are affordable to 
                   everyone. Our vision is to create a better everyday life for the 
                   many people - for customers, but also for our co-workers and the 
                   people who work at our suppliers.

                <h2>Business idea</h2>
                <p>While our vision tells us why we exist, our business idea tells us 
                   what we want to achieve. And for everyone that has visited IKEA, our 
                   business idea is pretty obvious - “to offer a wide range of well-
                   designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low, that 
                   as many people as possible will be able to afford them.”

            </div>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>This vision goes beyond home furnishing. We want our business to 
                    have a positive impact on the world - from the communities where 
                    we source our materials, to the way our products help our customers 
                    to live a more sustainable life at home.
                </p>
                <p>By sharing what we do, and speaking up for what we believe in, we 
                    can be part of a positive change in society.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-last">
                <p>That means we need to create products that have a beautiful design, 
                    good function, are sustainable, of good quality and are available at a 
                    low price. We call it “Democratic Design”, because we believe good home 
                    furnishing is for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>With great products that appeal to many people comes large production 
                    volumes, which means we get better deals and can offer our products 
                    at low prices. What's more, when packing and shipping our products in 
                    space-efficient flat-packs, storage and transportation costs are reduced, 
                    and we can lower our prices even more.
